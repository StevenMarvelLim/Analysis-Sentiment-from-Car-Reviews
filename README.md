# Analysis-Sentiment-from-Car-Reviews

This is a machine learning project focused on sentiment analysis of a dataset containing car review comments. The program will learn to identify positive and negative words, and then be tested by having us input example review sentences. The machine learning model will determine whether the sentiment of each sentence is positive or negative.
